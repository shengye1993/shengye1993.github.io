## 没有人是一座孤岛

今天看到一首诗，英国诗人John Donne写的，题目很喜欢，但是内容多少还是和我所想的有一些区别.看了各个译者的翻译，并没有特别喜欢的，就不在这里摘抄了。

~~~
John Donne (/ˈdʌn/ dun) (22 January 1572[1] – 31 March 1631) was an English poet and a cleric in the Church of England. He is considered the pre-eminent representative of the metaphysical poets. His works are noted for their strong, sensual style and include sonnets, love poems, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons.

### No Man Is An Island
_--John Donne_
 
<b>
No man is an island,   
entire of itself;   
every man is a piece of the continent,   
a part of the main; 
  
  
<b>
if a clod be washed away by the sea,   
Europe is the less,   
as well as if a promontory were,   
as well as if a manor of thy friend’s or of thine own were:  
 
 
<b>
any man’s death diminishes me,   
because I am involved in mankind,   
and therefore,   
never send to know for whom the bell tolls;   
it tolls for thee.
